# 🚀 Modern C++ Learning Journey with AI
> A comprehensive collection of modern C++ implementations, focusing on memory management, OOP patterns, and STL, assisted by AI code review.

## 📖 About The Project (專案簡介)
This repository documents my journey in mastering C++ programming. Unlike traditional textbook exercises, each module here focuses on specific core concepts of **Modern C++**, ranging from basic syntax to advanced memory management.

Key focus areas:
* **Modern Syntax** : Utilizing features from C++11 to C++20.
* **RAII & Memory Safety** : Smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) over raw pointers.
* **Performance** : Understanding STL containers and algorithms.
